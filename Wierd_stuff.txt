1. Error in building C code.

If there are includes that can't be resolved, this can be caused by
indexes that are out of date.  Changing Qsys and regenerating the BSP
(and hence system.h) causes the problem where the source code is correct
but the includes in system.h can't be resolved.

To fix this, select the project and right-click --> Index --> Rebuild.
Also may need to --> ReResolve Unresolved Includes.
The do a Project --> Clean

----------------------------------------------

2. The Board Support Package (settings.bsp) has a hard-coded path. Lines 7
and 8 must be edited to point to the directory where the bsp file is located.

<BspGeneratedLocation>/home/tom/TSDR-Dev/devkit_simple_socket_server-17_project/software/MOD_socket_server_bsp</BspGeneratedLocation>
<BspSettingsFile>/home/tom/TSDR-Dev/devkit_simple_socket_server-17_project/software/MOD_socket_server_bsp/settings.bsp</BspSettingsFile>

Otherwise it will attempt to overwrite the wrong directory when the
BSP is regenerated (anytime the Qsys peripherals change).
